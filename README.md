This offers open-source implementations of several functions common in global fisheries analysis. These functions are primarily used to assess the status of fish stocks in data poor environments where only the most basic information is available.

## Use Case ##

- Assessing the status of a fish stock based on a time-series of landings
	- Can be categorized as Developing, Exploited, Over-exploited, Collapsed or Rebuilding
- Estimate the Maximum Sustainable Yield for a fish stock based on a time-series of landings
- Estimate lost potential catch due to over-fishing.
